   * <p>BuildCompat.isAtLeast*() can be changed by Android Release team, and once that is changed it
   * may take weeks for that to propagate to stable/prerelease/experimental SDKs in Google3. Also it
   * can be different in all these channels. This can cause random issues, especially with sidecars
   * (i.e., the code running on R may not know that it runs on R).
   *
   * <p>This still should try using BuildCompat.isAtLeastR() as source of truth, but also checking
   * for VERSION_SDK_INT and VERSION.CODENAME in case when BuildCompat implementation returned
   * false. Note that both checks should be >= and not = to make sure that when Android version
   * increases (i.e., from R to S), this does not stop working.
   *
   * <p>Supported configurations:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>For current Android release: while new API is not finalized yet (CODENAME =
   *       "UpsideDownCake", SDK_INT = 33)
   *   <li>For current Android release: when new API is finalized (CODENAME = "REL", SDK_INT = 34)
   *   <li>For next Android release (CODENAME = "VanillaIceCream", SDK_INT = 35+)
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Note that Build.VERSION_CODES.T cannot be used here until final SDK is available in all
   * channels, because it is equal to Build.VERSION_CODES.CUR_DEVELOPMENT before API finalization.
   *
   * @return Whether the current OS version is higher or equal to U.
